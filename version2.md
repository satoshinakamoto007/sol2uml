# Version 2.x Changes

## Changes to the command line interface

* Class diagrams are now under a class subcommand. `sol2uml class`
* New storage subcommand to draw the storage slots of a contract. `sol2uml storage`
* New flatten subcommand that downloads the verified source code from Etherscan to a local Solidity file. `sol2uml flatten`

### Renamed command line options

* `-d --depthLimit` to `-sf --subfolders`
* `-a --hideAttributes` to `-hv --hideVariables`
* `-p --hideOperations` to `-hf --hideFunctions`
* `-e, --hideEnums` to `-he, --hideEnums`
* `-s, --hideStructs` to `-hs, --hideStructs`
* `-l, --hideLibraries` to `-hl, --hideLibraries`
* `-t, --hideInterfaces` to `-hi, --hideInterfaces`
* `-r, --hideInternals` to `-hp, --hidePrivates`

### New command line options

* Added `-d --depth` to limit the depth of contracts connected to the base contracts.
* Added `-ha --hideAbstract` to hide all abstract contracts.
  * Added `-hn, --hideFilename` to hide the relative filename of a contract.

# Fixes

* Improved linkages of classes when there are duplicate contract names.
* If a contract or library contains a struct, it is marked as an aggregate association. A separate dependency line is used to link a contract to a struct. This can be a storage (solid line) or memory (dashed line) dependency.
* Structs in libraries are now linked to their dependent contract.
